# Kimodo: Controllable Kinematic Motion Diffusion at Scale

**[Paper](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/kimodo/assets/kimodo_tech_report.pdf), [Project Page](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/kimodo/)**

### Description:
Kimodo (**Ki**nematic **Mo**tion **D**iffusi**o**n) generates three-dimensional (3D) skeletal body animations given a text prompt and/or constraints on the motion like full-body poses, end-effector joint positions, paths, and waypoints to follow.

The Kimodo model family includes models trained on different skeletons and datasets:
* Kimodo-SOMA-RP
    * Trained on the 30-joint SOMA skeleton with the proprietary Bones Rigplay dataset.
* Kimodo-SOMA-SEED
    * Trained on the 30-joint SOMA skeleton with the open Bones-SEED dataset.
* Kimodo-G1-RP
    * Trained on the proprietary Bones Rigplay dataset retargeted to the 34-joint Unitree G1 robot skeleton.
* Kimodo-G1-SEED
    * Trained on the open Bones-SEED dataset retargeted to the 34-joint Unitree G1 robot skeleton.
* Kimodo-SMPLX-RP
    * Trained on the proprietary Bones Rigplay dataset retargeted to the 22-joint SMPLX-body skeleton.

This release pertains to Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1.1. This model is ready for commercial use.

### Changes In v1.1
Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1.1 contains minor improvements over Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1 and makes the model compatible with the [Kimodo Motion Generation Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Kimodo-Motion-Gen-Benchmark):

* Updated the training split to not overlap with the test splits of the Kimodo benchmark, making it comparable with other models trained on BONES-SEED
* As a result of the updated splits, the training set is slightly larger than in v1, resulting in more diversity seen during training
* Further data cleaning performed to remove problematic motions with wrist and shoulder twist artifacts
* Improved training stability
